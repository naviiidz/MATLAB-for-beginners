# MATLAB Matrix Operations for Beginners

This repository is designed to help students learn the fundamentals of MATLAB, focusing on matrix operations. Each folder contains scripts that demonstrate basic and advanced matrix operations.

## Contents

### 01_Introduction
This section introduces basic concepts and operations in MATLAB, including:

- **Intro to MATLAB:** A basic introduction to the MATLAB environment, including simple calculations.
- **Intro to Matrices:** Introduction to creating and working with matrices.
- **Variables and Basic Operations:** Introduction to variable assignment and basic arithmetic operations.
- **Creating Vectors:** How to create row and column vectors using direct assignment, `linspace`, and the colon operator.
- **Vector Operations:** Basic operations on vectors, including addition, dot product, and cross product.
- **Indexing and Slicing:** Accessing and slicing elements from vectors and matrices.
- **Basic Plotting:** Simple 2D plotting, including annotating the plot.

### 02_Basic_Operations
This section covers fundamental matrix operations such as:

- **Matrix Addition:** Adding two matrices element-wise.
- **Matrix Subtraction:** Subtracting one matrix from another element-wise.
- **Matrix Multiplication:** Multiplying two matrices using the matrix multiplication rule.
- **Matrix Transpose:** Transposing a matrix (flipping it over its diagonal).
- **Matrix Scalar Multiplication:** Multiplying a matrix by a scalar value.
- **Matrix Element-wise Multiplication:** Performing element-wise multiplication of two matrices.
- **Matrix Division:** Performing matrix division using right division (A / B) and left division (A \ B).

### 03_Advanced_Operations
This section covers more advanced matrix operations including:

- **Matrix Inverse:** How to compute and verify the inverse of a square matrix.
- **Determinant:** Calculation of the determinant, including interpretation of its meaning (invertibility of the matrix).
- **Eigenvalues:** Finding the eigenvalues of a square matrix, a key concept in linear algebra.
- **Solving Linear Equations:** Multiple methods to solve linear equations represented in matrix form, including the use of inverse and left division.
- **Matrix Rank:** Determining the rank of a matrix, which indicates the dimension of the vector space spanned by its rows or columns.
- **Matrix Trace:** Calculating the trace of a matrix, which is the sum of the diagonal elements.
- **Matrix Power:** Raising a square matrix to an integer power.

### Examples
This section provides practical examples that combine multiple operations:

- **Example 1:** A simple example combining matrix addition, multiplication, and inversion.
- **Example 2:** An advanced example solving a system of linear equations using multiple methods.
